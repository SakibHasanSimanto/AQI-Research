#  A Data-Driven Environmental Decision Support System for Proactive AQI Forecasting Using Machine Learning and Explainable AI

## File Information 

AQI Codes.ipynb: A notebook containing all the codes used in conducting the research (e.g. modeling, evaluation). 

AQI_Forecasting_System.py: This is the source codes for the web application.

AQI_Dataset_Winter2024-25.csv : The dataset used for predictive modeling purposes / used in the research.  

AQI_Forecaster.pkl: The Decision Tree model which is used to develop the Streamlit-based web application. 


requirements.txt: Dependencies that are needed to be installed to run the app locally. 

However, running the app locally is not necesssary, since it can accessed online. Link is given: https://future-aqi-forecasting-system.streamlit.app/ 

Please note that, the application is still on the experimental and development phase.
